# Typhoon Analysis Dashboard

This project is a Dash-based web application for analyzing typhoon data in the West Pacific region. It provides various visualizations and analyses of typhoon tracks, wind speeds, pressures, and their relationships with the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI).

## Features

- Interactive typhoon track visualization
- Typhoon route clustering
- Wind speed and pressure analysis in relation to ONI
- ENSO phase impact analysis on typhoon generation
- Individual typhoon path animation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git
